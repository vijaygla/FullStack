## React Basic Error with initial file
- Import Resolution Errors:
    - The system is unable to resolve the imports for ./App.jsx and ./Sample.jsx from src/main.jsx. This usually means that the files App.jsx and Sample.jsx might not exist in the specified path.
- Strict Mode Class Name:
    - There’s a mention of “Strict Mode” in your class name, but it doesn’t seem to be directly related to the errors.
- JSX Syntax Errors:
    - There are syntax errors in your main.jsx file:
- Unterminated JSX contents at line 9, column 15.
- Unexpected token at line 10, column 0.
